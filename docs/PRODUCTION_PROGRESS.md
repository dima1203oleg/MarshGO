# MARSHGO Production Progress

## Phase 0 — Local audit and baseline

**Status:** Complete for the inspected baseline; the requested root task file was absent in this checkout, so the full technical specification pasted in the user message is the active source of requirements.

**Completed:** Verified initial `main` at `1e7d0ee` with a clean starting tree. Created branch `codex/marshgo-production` and committed the initial API/UI foundation as `34c8899`. Inspected the PWA and found its core state was browser-local demo storage. Fixed the Vite/esbuild dependency mismatch, made page views lazy-loaded, revised the home/results interface toward the supplied mobile references, and added client-side safeguards for demo workflows. Production Vite builds now fail closed with a launch-status screen instead of showing seeded offers and profiles as live data.

**Modified files:** `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/AppHeader.tsx`, `src/services/storage.ts`, `src/views/HomeView.tsx`, `src/views/SearchView.tsx`, `vite.config.ts`, `tests/storage.test.ts`, `.env.example`, `docs/PRODUCTION_AUDIT.md`.

**Database changes:** None in this phase.

**API endpoints:** None in this phase.

**Tests:** Bun frozen-lockfile install, typecheck, build, and the four browser-storage unit tests pass.

**Remaining issues:** Frontend workflows still use demo storage. The launch-status screen remains until the authenticated API client is integrated.

**External blockers:** None for this phase.

**Next implementation step:** Build the persistent API foundation for the two-phone booking path.

## Phase 2 — Auth, profiles, roles, and garage

**Status:** Partial; phone enrollment, database sessions, profile updates, role grants, and owner-bound vehicle CRUD/active selection are implemented and tested. Real photo storage and verification review remain incomplete.

**Completed:** Added migration `003_identity_auth.sql` for normalized user roles, account status, session refresh-token families, driver profiles, verification records, vehicle-photo metadata, and deletion requests. Added OTP request/verify endpoints with hashed challenges, five-minute expiry, 60-second resend cooldown, per-phone/IP hourly limits, failed-attempt limit, opaque access tokens, HttpOnly refresh cookie, refresh rotation/reuse revocation, logout, logout-all, profile read/update, role enabling, data export, and deletion request. Added a development-only no-network OTP adapter and a Twilio provider adapter that remains disabled until configured. Corrected auth error payloads, removed the duplicate profile route, preserved omitted profile fields, and made deletion requests non-destructive pending review. Role authorization now uses normalized `user_roles`. Added migration `004_vehicle_garage.sql` and owner-bound vehicle editing, atomic active-vehicle switching, and archive protection for future published trips. New vehicles default to the first active vehicle for that owner. Added AWS SDK S3-compatible signed photo upload/download/delete, 10 MiB and image-type policy, file-signature validation, and primary photo selection; operations return a controlled 503 while bucket configuration is absent.

**Modified files:** `server/index.ts`, `server/sms.ts`, `server/objectStorage.ts`, `server/migrations/003_identity_auth.sql`, `server/migrations/004_vehicle_garage.sql`, `server/migrations/006_vehicle_photo_primary.sql`, `tests/api-bookings.integration.test.ts`, `tests/object-storage.test.ts`, `.env.example`, `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/PRODUCTION_AUDIT.md`, `docs/PRODUCTION_PROGRESS.md`.

**Database changes:** `003_identity_auth.sql`, `004_vehicle_garage.sql`, and `006_vehicle_photo_primary.sql` applied successfully to the local PostGIS database.

**API endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/auth/otp/request`, `POST /api/v1/auth/otp/verify`, `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`, `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`, `POST /api/v1/auth/logout-all`, `GET|PATCH /api/v1/users/me`, `POST /api/v1/users/me/roles`, `GET /api/v1/users/me/export`, `POST /api/v1/users/me/deletion-requests`, `GET|POST /api/v1/vehicles`, `PATCH /api/v1/vehicles/:id`, `POST /api/v1/vehicles/:id/activate`, `DELETE /api/v1/vehicles/:id`, and vehicle photo upload/list/primary/delete endpoints.

**Tests:** Node 24.21.0: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` passed. Local integration command `API_TEST_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3002 API_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://marshgo:local_only_change_me@127.0.0.1:5434/marshgo npx --yes --package=node@24.21.0 -- node node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs --test tests/*.test.ts` passed all 11 tests, including OTP registration, profile persistence, refresh rotation, self-enabling driver role, vehicle creation, fail-closed missing S3, ownership/edit/active selection, last-seat contention, cancellation, negotiation, chat, OSRM contract, and signed upload-policy contract. The run caught and fixed malformed SQL in role grant before the 11/11 pass.

**Remaining issues:** Vehicle API supports listing and creation only. No vehicle edit/delete, object storage upload, photo processing, verification submission/reviewer workflow, or frontend auth/profile integration. The real SMS provider is not configured. One combined check run initially raced `tsc` against `vite build` clearing `dist`; sequential typecheck passes. No production deployment.

**External blockers:** Twilio account credentials and approved sender identity for real SMS; private S3-compatible bucket, credentials/role, and browser CORS configuration; trusted staff account provisioning and verification policy. Signed policy and media-validation adapter are unit-tested using local fake credentials; no real bucket was contacted.

**Next implementation step:** Finish vehicle ownership-bound CRUD and photo-storage provider contract, then connect the frontend session/profile/vehicle flows.

## Phase 5 — Production UI integration (first marketplace vertical slice)

**Status:** Partial; production bundle uses real OTP/session, offer search, booking, and booking history APIs. The existing full demo UI remains development-only.

**Completed:** Added a typed browser API client with HttpOnly refresh-cookie credentials and one retry after access-token expiry. Added mobile-first production sign-in, verified phone flow, server-backed exact-city/date/seat search, booking with a fresh Idempotency-Key, and persisted booking list. `App` now chooses the API-backed marketplace for production builds and keeps the local demo UI out of production execution. Added Vite local API proxy routes. Search API now filters by Europe/Kyiv calendar date and requested seats.

**Modified files:** `src/services/productionApi.ts`, `src/views/ProductionMarketplace.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `server/index.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `tests/api-bookings.integration.test.ts`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/PRODUCTION_PROGRESS.md`.

**Database changes:** None in this slice.

**API endpoints:** Uses `POST /auth/otp/request`, `POST /auth/otp/verify`, `POST /auth/refresh`, `POST /auth/logout`, `GET /offers?origin=&destination=&date=&seats=`, `GET /bookings`, and `POST /bookings`.

**Tests:** `npm run typecheck`, scoped `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and local PostGIS integration suite passed. The API integration suite includes date/seat search filters and booking transaction tests. No browser automation or physical-device run was performed.

**Remaining issues:** Production PWA still lacks authenticated driver offer creation/vehicle management, reverse-demand UI, trip lifecycle, chat, GPS navigation, and passive matching. Existing demo UI remains only in the development build. Search is exact city-name matching. The 15-minute access token renewal path is implemented but not tested through a browser session.

**External blockers:** Production SMS credentials/sender, staging API host and HTTPS same-site deployment, S3 photo storage credentials, routing provider service.

**Next implementation step:** Add a real driver publishing/garage flow to the production UI, then integrate demand negotiation and booking chat against existing APIs.

## Phase 6 — Routing foundation

**Status:** Partial; OSRM-compatible road-route adapter and server persistence contract are implemented. A real routing service is not configured.

**Completed:** Added `server/routing.ts` with bounded-timeout OSRM-compatible route fetch, geometry/range validation, and explicit provider failures. Added `POST /api/v1/routing/route`. Added migration `005_offer_routes.sql` for arrival time, road distance, duration, and source. Production offer creation now requires a successful configured road route and stores geometry/ETA; it returns 503 when routing is unavailable. Development-only unrouted fixtures are labeled `development_unrouted`. Production search presents the server route-derived ETA only when available.

**Modified files:** `server/routing.ts`, `server/index.ts`, `server/migrations/005_offer_routes.sql`, `.env.example`, `src/services/productionApi.ts`, `src/views/ProductionMarketplace.tsx`, `tests/routing.test.ts`, `tests/api-bookings.integration.test.ts`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/PRODUCTION_PROGRESS.md`.

**Database changes:** `005_offer_routes.sql` applied to the local PostGIS database.

**API endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/routing/route`, updated `POST /api/v1/offers`, and `GET /api/v1/offers` now returns saved route metadata.

**Tests:** Node 24.21.0 LTS: typecheck, scoped lint, production build, unit suite, and opt-in local PostGIS integration suite passed. The combined routing+API suite passed 10/10 tests, including a local HTTP OSRM contract fixture and the honest 503 behavior when no routing provider is configured. No public routing provider was called.

**Remaining issues:** `ROUTING_ENGINE_URL` is unset; production offer creation is correctly blocked until an owned routing service/provider is configured. No geocoder/address suggestion, multi-stop routing, rerouting, or real GPS stream exists. Tests validate the provider contract, not a live road network.

**External blockers:** Provisioned OSRM/Valhalla hosting or contracted routing API and service limits.

**Next implementation step:** Implement route/date/seat aware offer creation and search in the production driver UI, then connect reverse demands to route corridors and mutual matching.

## Phase 1 — Backend, PostgreSQL/PostGIS foundation

**Status:** Partial; local API/database infrastructure and persistent domain slices exist. OpenAPI, production orchestration, and shared Redis-backed services remain missing.

**Completed:** Added Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL/PostGIS and Redis with named persistent volumes; applied initial schema migration locally. Added Express API health/readiness, database-backed offer lookup, profile/vehicle reads, driver-only vehicle creation, verified-vehicle-only offer publication, server session-hash checking, explicit development-only identity bypass, request-size cap, allowlisted CORS, security headers, per-process API rate limit, and centralized errors. Added transactionally locked bookings with server-priced totals, idempotency keys, conversation creation, audit event, ownership-checked cancellation, and once-only seat restoration. Production UI now blocks demo inventory. Added ESLint for touched/backend files and a GitHub Actions workflow for lint, typecheck, tests, and build.

**Modified files:** `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `eslint.config.js`, `server/index.ts`, `server/migrate.ts`, `server/migrations/001_initial.sql`, `server/migrations/002_reverse_marketplace.sql`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/AppHeader.tsx`, `src/services/storage.ts`, `src/views/SearchView.tsx`, `tests/api-bookings.integration.test.ts`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/PRODUCTION_AUDIT.md`.

**Database changes:** Added `001_initial.sql`: users, vehicles, offers with PostGIS points and route geometry, bookings, passenger demands, proposals, conversations/members, messages, OTP challenges, sessions, audit events, indexes and constraints. Added `002_reverse_marketplace.sql` with proposal vehicle/time/revision columns, revision history and one-accepted-proposal-per-demand guard. Both migrations were applied to the local Docker database.

**API endpoints:** `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`, `GET /api/v1/offers`, `GET /api/v1/users/me`, `GET|POST /api/v1/vehicles`, `POST /api/v1/offers`, `POST|GET /api/v1/demands`, `POST /api/v1/demands/:id/proposals`, `POST /api/v1/proposals/:id/counter`, `POST /api/v1/proposals/:id/accept`, `GET /api/v1/proposals/:id/revisions`, `GET /api/v1/bookings`, `POST /api/v1/bookings`, `POST /api/v1/bookings/:id/cancel`, `GET /api/v1/bookings/:id/conversation`, `GET|POST /api/v1/conversations/:id/messages`.

**Tests:** Lint/typecheck/build pass. Automated local PostGIS API integration tests verify OTP/session, anonymous denial, two simultaneous users competing for the last seat (one 201, one 409), same-key replay, repeated cancellation and seat restoration, vehicle ownership/role/verification, date/seat search, demand negotiation/revision history, accepted-proposal booking conversion, participant message send/history, and third-party privacy denial. All 8 tests pass. `docker compose config` and migrations pass. No API-driven two-device UI test yet. Repository-wide lint found legacy UI warnings/errors; current lint scope is new/backend and touched files only.

**Remaining issues:** Most legacy PWA screens are not API-wired. Vehicle verification review, photo storage, demand cancellation, booking lifecycle, realtime message delivery, routing/geographic search, shared Redis rate limiting, generated OpenAPI, production orchestration, backup/restore, and production-grade observability are not implemented. Redis is currently provisioned but unused. Current offer search uses exact city names.

**External blockers:** SMS provider/account and sender identity; staging/production host and database; secrets manager; routing/geocoding source decision. No public deploy or production database action performed.

**Next implementation step:** Complete user/session enrollment after the SMS provider is selected, then connect the frontend account/profile and vehicle screens to these endpoints.

## Booking transaction backend (spec Phase 3)

**Status:** Backend transaction slice implemented; cross-device application flow remains blocked on authentication and frontend integration.

**Completed:** Database-backed offer lookup, offer publishing for an owned verified vehicle, seat-locked booking, replay-safe idempotency, fixed server pricing, cancellation and single seat restoration. Tested with two independent local user identities racing for the last seat.

**Remaining issues:** Search is exact city text only; frontend still uses browser-local offers and booking state; owner-side trip management, confirmations/QR, and lifecycle notifications are missing. This is not the user acceptance test on two physical phones.

**Next implementation step:** Create secure user enrollment/session issuance, wire the PWA to session-protected offer/booking endpoints, and run the cross-device scenario in staging.

## Reverse marketplace backend (spec Phase 4)

**Status:** Backend API flow implemented and locally transaction-tested; frontend and messaging integration remain incomplete.

**Completed:** Passenger demand submission, driver proposal using a verified vehicle, alternating counter-offers with server-stored revision history, expiry checks, passenger-only acceptance, atomic booking creation, seat consumption, competing proposal rejection, and conversation participant creation.

**Remaining issues:** PWA screens still use local data. Persisted message routes exist, but there is no realtime transport or live notification. No geographic relevance ranking, driver matching, or route deviation calculation.

**Next implementation step:** Wire demand and driver negotiation views to API and test the flow through the authenticated PWA.

## Chat persistence backend (spec Phase 7)

**Status:** Persistent chat API slice implemented; realtime and push remain incomplete.

**Completed:** Conversations are created with booking acceptance. Booking participants can resolve their conversation, send bounded messages, and read persisted history. Both routes verify membership; a third-party access test returns 404.

**Remaining issues:** The PWA chat still uses local demo state. No WebSocket, push provider, unread counts, notification subscriptions, or rescue alternatives.

**Next implementation step:** Connect the PWA Messages view to these endpoints, then add realtime delivery using shared Redis-backed coordination.
